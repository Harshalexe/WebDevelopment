# WebDevelopment using Django
In this project, I have created a dynamic website using Python and the Django framework,
aiming to showcase the seamless integration of technology and functionality. 
Leveraging the power of Django's robust features, the website embodies interactivity and responsiveness at its core. 
Through the fusion of back-end Python scripting and front-end design, users can experience a smooth and intuitive browsing experience. 
To provide an in-depth understanding of the project's essence and mechanics, a comprehensive video has been crafted,
demonstrating its functionalities, user flows, and key features. This repository serves as a testament to the potential of
web development with Python and Django, offering developers and enthusiasts an insightful glimpse into the project's architecture and operation.

Video Given below shows how the website works and how can you access it also i have shown backend where the data is stored:
